# Sugar
An Android App to help monitoring the own sugar consumption (or the consumption of some other nutrients).

# Language
The app should be displayed in german or english, depending on your phone's settings.

# Function
Record your own eating behaviour regarding three nutrients (you can specify the nutrients in the setting; refer to the wrench symbol in the top menu).

<h3>Tab today</h3>
If you are above a certain objective value (which you can specify by touching the corresponding nutrient fields in tab 'today'), this fact is shown by a red bar color in the corresponding field.
If you are close to this value, namely above 75 percent, it is indicated by a yellow bar. Otherwise the color of the bar is green.

<h3>Tab list</h3>
In this tab you can add a new entry by touching the '+' symbol at the bottom and then filling the fields.
The date is pre-set to the current date, but you can change it.
If you touch such an entry of the list, it is possible to edit it.
Finally, if you touch an entry for a longer amount of time, it will be deleted (a confirmation dialog appears before this happens).

<h3>Tab history</h3>
In this tab you can observe your eating behaviour for the last days. It is possible to show between 5 and 30 days (touch the fields to change the number of days).

<h3>Tab categories</h3>
In this tab you can add (or change/delete) new categories of food. Those categories can be selected when adding a new entry in the tab 'list', in order to create such entries faster. At the beginning there are some default categories present with realistic nutrient data.

<h3>General</h3>
Usually the current date is shown in tabs 'today' and 'list'. By selecting another date in the top menu you can change the date and then also edit older entries in the tab 'list' (if needed).<br/>
Moreover, it is possible to export and import your settings and categories. This funcionality can be found in the head menu. For the import make sure that you type in the correct file name.<br/>
Also in the head menu you find a function to delete and reset certain things, like the objective values, the categories, or the saved data (up to a certain date which you can choose).
